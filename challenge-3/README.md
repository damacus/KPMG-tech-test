## Challenge #3

We have a nested object, we would like a function where you:

- Pass in the object and a key
- Get back the value

How this is implemented is up to you.

## Example Inputs

```ruby
object = {“a”:{“b”:{“c”:”d”}}}
key = a/b/c
```

```ruby
object = {“x”:{“y”:{“z”:”a”}}}
key = x/y/z
value = a
```
